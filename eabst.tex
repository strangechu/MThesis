Bird flock animation plays an important role in making realistic outdoor scenes in games and movies. However, since making bird flock animation involves a large quantity of moving entities, it takes effort to create and control them. To solve this problem, we introduce a new approach to make this task easier. Our main idea is using a single-view video as input.  From the input video, by using animal tracking technique, the two-dimensional position of each bird is retrieved in each frame. We then predict the depth information of each bird by minimizing error function based on trajectory smoothness and flock behavior. With the predicted depth, the three-dimensional bird flock animation is then generated. In this research, we focus on synthesizing three-dimensional flock motion from two-dimensional projection. Generating visually plausible result is our goal. We show our system is capable of generating bird flock motion from various input videos.
