\section{Evaluation}


In this paper, we aim to synthesize visually plausible flock motion from video by However, as mentioned in Chapter 1, due to difficulties of obtaining data from real flocks, we do not have ground truth to numerically evaluate our method.


\section{Bird tracking}


Another limitation in our system is that we assume all birds stay in the view field of camera. Although it is possible to generate this kind of video from flock simulation system, it is difficult to have such video from real bird flock video. It is common that birds leave and enter the view field, which is not considered in our system. In addition, our system assumes that camera is placed in a fixed position, while it is common that bird videos are taken with moving cameras.


\section{Flock modeling}


Modeling flocks can be further studied to make better flock motion. In this research we only consider trajectory smoothness and flock behavior. However, we do not consider environmental effect such as wind or obstacles. In addition, bird locomotion is also not considered while it is a critical part for creating natural flock motion. 
Although the system allows user to change parameters to modify result, the ability of modification is still quite limited. 


\section{Sketch input}


The system can be further developed to receive human-drawn sketch as input. Since human sketch is similar to two-dimension track data obtained from video.
