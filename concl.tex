\chapter{Conclusion}


In this research, we proposed a novel approach for creating bird flock motion from video based on two-dimensional projections. The proposed system aims to help user to create and model bird flock motion by presenting a bird video as a reference. The system also provides interactive user interface to adjust the generated result in real time by tuning parameters.
The benefits of our approach are twofold: providing a new way to create bird flocks by using video input as reference; and the ability to predict three-dimensional flock motion from two-dimensional projection. We tested our system on creating flocks from video, after manual tracking is done, user can adjust parameters and see the result interactively to make better flock motion according to userâ€™s wish.
We hope that this research can improve the efficiency of creating rich scenes with flocks in game or movie industry and make it easy for repetitive parameter tuning tasks.
