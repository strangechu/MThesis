\chapter{Conclusion}


In this research, a novel approach for creating bird flock motion from video based on two-dimensional projection is proposed. The proposed system aims to help user to create and model bird flock motion by presenting a bird video as a reference. The system also provides interactive user interface to adjust the generated result in real time by tuning parameters. The benefits of our approach are twofold: providing a new way to create bird flocks by using video input as reference; and the ability to predict three-dimensional flock motion from two-dimensional track of bird flock. An interactive interface is also proposed for user to adjust parameters and see the result in real time to make better flock motion according to user's wish. We also show our generated results to validate that our system  is capable of generating various kind of bird flocks from video. We hope that this research can improve the efficiency of creating rich scenes with bird flocks in game or movie industry.
