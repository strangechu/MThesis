I would like to thank my supervisor, Professor Takeo Igarashi, for all the guidance and insight he provided me during the course of my master degree. Without his help, this thesis would hardly have been completed. I would also like to thank Professor Tsukasa Fukusato for his advice and assistance in keeping my progress on schedule. I also want to thank I-Chao Shen for his useful suggestions.   


Finally, I would like to express my greatest gratitude to my family for their continuous help and support. They encouraged me to explore new directions in life, making this amazing adventure of my life happen.
